# Edward Emory Legacy Codex

This repository contains the **Legacy Codex**, a distilled framework of how a neurodivergent, high‑pattern‑recognition mind partners with AI to build real things in the world. It emerged from a breakthrough session on November 2–3, 2025.

## What’s inside

- **7‑Phase Collaboration Protocol** – a step‑by‑step method for working with AI or collaborators, from initial assumption to meta‑recognition.
- **Legacy Codex architecture** – a structure for preserving the essence of Edward’s thinking: keystone principles, narratives, artifacts and long‑term continuity plans.
- **Transmission framework** – identifies the four vehicles through which this work spreads (Narratives, People, Artifacts, Structures).
- **Continuity blueprint** – immediate and long‑term actions to turn insights into a living practice.
