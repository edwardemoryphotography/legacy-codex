# Edward Emory Legacy Codex

This repository contains the Legacy Codex, a distilled framework for how a neurodivergent, high-pattern-recognition mind partners with AI to build real-world outputs. It emerged from a breakthrough session on November 2-3, 2025.

## Current release

- Release: **v18** (documentation and deployment visibility update)
- Dashboard runtime: **v17** (single-file operational dashboard in `index.html`)
- Canonical release notes: `CHANGELOG.md`

## What is inside

- **7-Phase Collaboration Protocol** - a step-by-step method for working with AI or collaborators, from initial assumption to meta-recognition.
- **Legacy Codex architecture** - a structure for preserving keystone principles, narratives, artifacts, and long-term continuity plans.
- **Transmission framework** - the four vehicles through which this work spreads (Narratives, People, Artifacts, Structures).
- **Continuity blueprint** - immediate and long-term actions to turn insight into repeatable practice.

## Why this update matters

v18 establishes explicit changelog and deployment references so downstream AI agent runs can resolve the latest state without returning empty or stale results.
